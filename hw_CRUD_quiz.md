# CRUD Quiz

Use the solution to this afternoon's Property Tracker lab to answer the following questions. Please write your answers under each question, push the file to GitHub, and submit in the usual way.

## MVP Questions

In our Property Tracker application:

Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the `Property` class?

<!-- console.rb -->

Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby `Property` object into the database?

<!-- def save in property.rb -->

Q3. In `console.rb`, which lines modify the database?

<!-- Line 13, Line 22, Line 31, and Line 33. -->

Q4. Why do we not define the id of a `Property` object at the point we instantiate it (‘new it up’)?

<!-- Because the primary key will automatically assign it an id. -->

Q5. Where and how do we assign the id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby `Property` object?

<!-- We assign the id to the object in the def initialize of property.rb using an instance variable called '@id' -->

Q6. Why do we put a guard (an `if` clause) on the `@id` attribute in the constructor?

<!-- The if statement is to check if the id attribute corresponds to the id we want to work with. -->

Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others by class methods?

<!-- Because we use instance methods for instances of a class, and class methods for the class in general. -->

Q8. What type of data structure is returned by calls to `db.exec_prepared()`? In the `save` method, how do we access the id from the returned data structure?

<!-- A hash is returned. We access the id by checking the index of the structure returned by out exec_prepared call, then convert it to an integer with .to_i -->

Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations?

<!-- We use prepared statements because we can run the same statements multiple times with different arguments. -->



## Extension Questions

Look at the `find_by_id` and `find_by_address` methods in the `Property` class.

Q10. What do they take in as their arguments?

<!-- 'find_by_id' takes in the id variable of property2, and 'find_by_address' takes in the string address of property 3. -->

Q11. What are their return values?

<!-- The return value of 'find_by_id' is a hash of property2, and the return value of 'find_by_address' is a hash of property3. -->
